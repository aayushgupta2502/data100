Contains projects developed in UC Berkeley's Principles and Techniques of Data Science course.

Project 1: Housing
This project explores what can be learned from an extensive housing data set that is embedded in a dense social context in Cook County, Illinois.
In part A, I conducted some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the data. 
Next, I added a few new features to the dataset, while cleaning the data as well in the process.

In part B, I specified and fit a linear model for the purpose of prediction. 
Finally, I analyzed the error of the model and brainstormed ways to improve the model's performance.

Project 2: Spam & Ham
Created a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. 
Developed comfort with:
--Feature engineering with text data
--Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
--Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
--Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
